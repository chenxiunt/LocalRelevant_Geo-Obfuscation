Artifacts HotCRP Id: **10**

Requested Badge: **Available**

## Description
A short description of your artifact and how it links to your paper.

### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns
There is no security issue and ethical concerns. 

## Basic Requirements (Only for Functional and Reproduced badges)
Describe the minimal hardware and software requirements of your artifact and estimate the compute time and storage required to run the artifact.

### Hardware Requirements
If your artifact requires specific hardware to be executed, mention that here.
Provide instructions on how a reviewer can gain access to that hardware through remote access, buying or renting, or even emulating the hardware.
Make sure to preserve the anonymity of the reviewer at any time.

### Software Requirements
Describe the OS and software packages required to evaluate your artifact.
This description is essential if you rely on proprietary software or software that might not be easily accessible for other reasons.
Describe how the reviewer can obtain and install all third-party software, data sets, and models.

### Estimated Time and Storage Consumption
Provide an estimated value for the time the evaluation will take and the space on the disk it will consume. 
This helps reviewers to schedule the evaluation in their time plan and to see if everything is running as intended.
More specifically, a reviewer, who knows that the evaluation might take 10 hours, does not expect an error if, after 1 hour, the computer is still calculating things.

## Environment 
In the following, describe how to access our artifact and all related and necessary data and software components.
Afterward, describe how to set up everything and how to verify that everything is set up correctly.

### Accessibility (All badges)
Describe how to access your artifact via persistent sources.
Valid hosting options are institutional and third-party digital repositories.
Do not use personal web pages.
For repositories that evolve over time (e.g., Git Repositories ), specify a specific commit-id or tag to be evaluated.
In case your repository changes during the evaluation to address the reviewer's feedback, please provide an updated link (or commit-id / tag) in a comment.

### Set up the environment (Only for Functional and Reproduced badges)
Describe how the reviewers should set up the environment for your artifact, including downloading and installing dependencies and the installation of the artifact itself.
Be as specific as possible here.
If possible, use code segments to simply the workflow, e.g.,

```bash
git clone git@my_awesome_artifact.com/repo
apt install libxxx xxx
```
Describe the expected results where it makes sense to do so.
